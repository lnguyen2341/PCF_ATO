# The purpose of this project is to assist those needing to get security approval-to-operate (ATO) for their cloud native platforms, such as Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF): Pivotal Application Service (PAS), and Pivotal Container Service (PKS).  This project contains guidelines and example artifacts that contribute to the system security plan (SSP) or the body of evidence (BOE) that is submitted for ATO approval.
